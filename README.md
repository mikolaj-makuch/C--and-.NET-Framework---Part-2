# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NEW Framework

# Projects

- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/mikolaj-makuch/C-and-.NET-Framework-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance/CarInsurance)
- [Black Jack](https://github.com/mikolaj-makuch/C-and-.NET-Framework-Projects/tree/main/Black-Jack/Black%20Jack)

# Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web appliaction that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

# Black Jack

This project is a visualization of a popular casino game called Black Jack or twenty-one. You can almost feel like you are in a real casino.
